Other Details
---------------------

1. The program uses Java's `Semaphore` class for thread synchronization and coordination. Ensure that your Java environment supports this class.
2. The random generation of guest attributes, such as the number of bags, is implemented using Java's `Random` class. This ensures that each run of the program may yield different results.
3. The program will create and manage multiple threads for guests, front desk employees, and bellhops to simulate hotel operations. Ensure that your system can handle this multi-threaded environment.

Please reach out if you encounter any issues or have questions about running the program.

Happy simulating!
